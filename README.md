A shiny app for easily customized spaced repetition flash card learning.

Strobe is an idea for a simple and easily customizable spaced-repetition
flash-card ShinyApp (get it\!? :))

Elements that I want to build in over the next month:

  - ShinydashboardPlus flip cards
  - Choice of time frame to compress repetition for particular deadlines
  - Link to googlesheets for new or existing study cards
  - Or work off of upload/download files
  - Bonus features I could explore:
      - other persistent storage option for those who want to spin up on
        their own
      - flash card API to pull from?
      - prepopulated country presidents list for vignette
      - various cutomization of the spaced-repetition approach.

Might look at some research links as well for fun:
