A shiny app for easily customized spaced repetition flash card learning.

Strobe is an idea for a simple and easily customizable spaced-repetition flash-card ShinyApp (get it!? :))

Elements that I want to build in over the next month:

* ShinydashboardPlus flip cards
* Choice of time frame to compress repetition for particular deadlines
* Link to googlesheets for new or existing study cards
* Or work off of upload/download files
* Bonus features I could explore:
  - other persistent storage option for those who want to spin up on their own
  - flash card API to pull from?
  - prepopulated country presidents list for vignette
  - various cutomization of the spaced-repetition approach.

Might look at some research links as well for fun:
